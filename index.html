        <h2> 1. DERIVE 
            I= (2mgh-mr^2w^2)/w^2( n2+n1/n2)
        </h2>
        <ul>  where m= mass of slotted weight <br>
                    w= angular velocity of flywheel <br>
                    r= radius of flywheel axle <br>
                    h= height from grnd to bering <br>
                    n2= no of oscillations upto flywheel stops 
                    n1 = no of turns of thread on axle 
        </ul>

        <h3> Derivation</h3>
        <p>  According to law of conservation of energy <br>
            <h4> Potential energy loss = K.E (flywheel) + K.E(  falling mass) + n1W ( work done against friction)</h4>
               <h4>     mgh         =        Iw^2/2         +    MV^2/2      +       n1W </h4>
                  <h4> <style>" font size = 24pxl " now work done against friction when the flywheel completed its n2 oscillations</style> </h4> <br>
                   n2W = Iw^2/2 <br>
                   W=Iw^2/2n2<br>
                  And v= wr<br> 
                  Now equation becomes<br> <br>
                  mgh = Iw^2/2  +  mr^2w^2/2 + n1 Iw^2/2n2<br>
                  2mgh-mr^2w^2 = Iw^2 (n2+ n1/n2)<br><br>
                  (2mgh-mr^2w^2)/w^2(n2+n1/n2) =I<br><br>
                  <h4> Hence proved </h4>

        <h2>2. What is principle of flywheel?</h2>
            It is a rotating device used to store energy  mechanically in the form of kinetic energy for short duration  by spinning a mass at high speed  and  supply  back when required .<br>
        <h2> 3. What is application of flywheel?</h2>
               Reciprocating engine , automobiles,riveting machines etc. <br>
        <h2>  4. What do you mean by angular velocity ?  </h2>
               Rate of change of angular displacement is called angular velocity. 
         <h2> 5. Define parallel and perpendicular axis theorem. </h2>
                PARALLEL Axis Theorem<br>
                MOI of a body about its any axis parallel to the axis passing through com  is sum of moi of parallel axis and product of mass and square of distance between them .<br>
                I(about any axis) = I ( about axis passing through com ) + mr^<br>>  
                PERPENDICULAR Axis Theorem<br>
                MOI of a body  of a body about an axis perpendicular to plane is equal to sum of moi of body about two perpendicular axis which lie on same plane.
